# Three-dimensional Finite element method 

* Build on top of the Trilinos project: https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos

* Uses: Gmsh, Metis, Boost, Epetra, Amesos, AztecOO, Stratimikos, Teuchos, ML, amongst others.
* Handles linear and quadratic interpolations (tetra, hexas)
* Laplace
* Linearized elasticity
* Compressible hyperelasticity
* Nearly incompressible hyperelasticity (three-field formulation with static condensation)
* Essential and natural boundary conditions, deformation dependent natural conditions
* Stochastic boundary value problems
* Simulation of arterial walls with uncertainties (generation of Gaussian fields not included)
